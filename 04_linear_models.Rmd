```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Prediction with linear regression


Uploading the packages
```{r, results = FALSE, message = FALSE }
lapply (c("ggplot2","tidyverse","ape", "binom", "car", "emmeans", "lmerTest", "metafor", "MuMIn", "pwr", "visreg"), library, character.only = TRUE)

```



When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
