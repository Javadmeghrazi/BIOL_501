Analysis of original graph: 3.5/5
Quality and analysis of new graph: 3/5
R code: 5/5

11.5/15

Good description of study background
Good identification of key issues with the original graph
The slope and confidence interval are useful additions
Removing some of the clutter on the graph (colours, etc.)
  improves focus on the main pattern


Explain why the addition of a slope and confidence interval
  improves visualization of the main pattern and explain
  why the original figure is ineffective at showing the
  lack of association between the two variables
The conclusions argued aren't easy to see in comparison
  of the two plots. Clarify in particular how the second
  plot shows the role of other mutations, given that these
  are not represented on the figure. If only one plot was
  intended to be the focus of the assignment, state this
Plots have the same axes but different distributions of 
  points - explain what points represent in visreg plots.
  Similarly, differences between the graphs are not 
  intuitive - consider what could be adjusted to make
  the differences and therefore overall patterns more
  clear
